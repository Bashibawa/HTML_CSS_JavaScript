      <h3>Why choose Barter Trades</h3>
      <p> Money is less abundant in circulation while goods & services remain redundant. This medium can remedy them both.</p>
      <p>For example, a rice farmer needs to spend a minimum of 2 months to sell the quantity of rice to pay an equivalent amount as school fee for his son in a boarding school. Mean while the boarding school Administration needs to purchase rice from the market to sustain her students feeding for a term. This medium can save the farmer the stress of selling the rice in the market for a long period before paying the fees. He could as a Barter trader resume school with His son along with the equivalent amount of rice which can sustain the school system for that term.</p>
